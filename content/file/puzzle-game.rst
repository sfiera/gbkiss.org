Gameplay
--------

Two gameplay modes are provided: 15 Puzzle and Panel de Pon.

15 Puzzle
~~~~~~~~~

`15 Puzzle`_ is a sliding block puzzle played on a 4×4 grid. One of the 16 positions is removed and the remaining blocks are shuffled. The player must slide adjacent blocks into the empty position until all 15 blocks are in their original position.

Panel de Pon
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Panel de Pon is a “Lights-Out_”-type game unrelated to the Tetris Attack/Puzzle League games known in Japan as `Panel de Pon`_. In easy mode, the game is played on a 4×4 grid, and in hard mode, the grid is 6×6. Selecting any square will flip it and all adjacent squares between off (blank) and on (showing the image). The game is complete when all squares are on.
