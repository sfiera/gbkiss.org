What is GBKiss?
---------------

GBKiss is a platform developed by `Hudson Soft`_ and released in 1997 for the `Nintendo Game Boy`_. Supported cartridges_ can store files_ and transfer them wirelessly over infrared.

Hudson developed a number of files for the platform and distributed them in a number ways:

*  As built-in software (`Kiss-Mon 2`_) distributed with `Pocket Bomberman`_;
*  Through a `promotional cartridge`_ in partnership with the Famitsu Bros gaming magazine;
*  With the `GBKiss Link`_ infrared modem, bundled on an included floppy disk; and
*  As downloads on the Hudson website for use with the GBKiss Link.

GBKiss was never released outside of Japan. It was supported only for a short time, and it is unclear how widely GBKiss software was ever distributed. This website serves to document and preserve it.
