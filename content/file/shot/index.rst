Trivia
------

One of Hudson’s executives, `Takahashi Meijin`_ (“Master Takahashi”), was known for his ability to fire with a controller 16 times per second. Hudson made various products which reference this ability, such as the “Hudson Shooting Watch” handheld game, or feature him as a character, such as “Adventure Island”.
