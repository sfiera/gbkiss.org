Family Shot connects to the `Game Boy Printer`_ and prints a photo of the current residents of the player’s house in `Pocket Family GB`_. There are two options:

*  A: print the photo with the current date and time in the lower left
*  B: print the photo with “© 1998 HUDSON SOFT” in the lower left

After printing the photo, the app automatically exits.
