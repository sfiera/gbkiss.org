Trivia

Hudson released the original game `Binary Land`_ in 1983 and ported it to several platforms including the Famicom_.

At 8179 bytes, BINARY is the largest GBKiss file, and is just 5 bytes short of the maximum size. GBKiss files must fit into a single 8KiB (8192B) CRAM bank, and a minimum of 8 bytes of each CRAM bank are reserved for bookkeeping, so the maximum size is 8184 bytes.
