Photos
~~~~~~

Hudson developed the GBKiss software `Family Shot`_ and distributed it through their website. It adds extra functionality to the game: it will produce a photo of the current tenant family and print it to the `Game Boy Printer`_.

Characters
~~~~~~~~~~

Pocket Family GB contains a variety of characters, from babies (#1–7) to gunmen (#99) to alien grannies (#260). In total, 284 characters are programmed into the game. It also has the ability to load up to 6 additional characters from GBKiss files, occupying slots #285–290. If present on the cartridge, they can be invited through the in-game “Event” menu.

The official guidebook claims a “Ninja” character was available from the Hudson website (p. 47) but no archived version of the website seems to reference it.

Alarms
~~~~~~

Pocket Family has an alarm clock feature in the settings menu. The player can set a time and an `alarm tone`_. There are 9 built-in alarm tones:

* めざましおん: “Alarm Tone” (2 variants)
* ピンポンおん: “Doorbell” (4 variants)
* ほうかごチャイム: “Afterschool chime”
* きゅうきゅうしゃ: “Ambulance”
* きよし　このよる: “Silent Night”

Additional alarm tones can be loaded into the game as GBKiss data files. Hudson distributed one such file through their website, `Saita Saita`_.
