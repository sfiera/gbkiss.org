Kiss Menu
=========

:lang: en
:slug: file/menu

In the GBKiss menu, players can select files with the D-Pad and A. There are six options in the menu:

*  実行 (“Run”): execute software, or open data in the associated software
*  情報 (“Info”): show information about the selected file
*  整理 (“Organize”): move the selected file to a different position in the menu
*  送信 (“Send”): initiate sending the selected file to another cartridge
*  受信 (“Receive”): initiate receiving a file from another cartridge
*  削除 (“Delete”): delete the selected file

When “Receive” is chosen on a non-empty slot, the selected file will be deleted and replaced with the received file. The Start button immediately enters Receive mode, and selects the next empty slot automaticaly.

B exits GBKiss. Holding down Select while using the D-Pad enables fast scrolling.

The GBKiss menu has slots for 120 files, but due to storage_ limits it is not possible to store that many files on most cartridges_.
