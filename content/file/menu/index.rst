Kiss Menu
=========

:lang: en
:slug: file/menu

In the GBKiss menu, players can select files with the D-Pad and A. There are six options in the menu:

*  実行 (“Run”): execute software, or open data in the associated software
*  情報 (“Info”): show information about file
*  整理 (“Organize”): move file to a different position in the menu
*  送信 (“Send”): initiate sending the file to another cartridge
*  受信 (“Receive”): initiate receiving a file from another cartridge
*  削除 (“Delete”): delete the file

The Start button immediately goes to the Send screen. B exits GBKiss. Holding down Select while using the D-Pad enables fast scrolling.

The GBKiss menu has slots for 120 files, but due to block_ size limits it is not possible to store that many files on most cartridges_.
